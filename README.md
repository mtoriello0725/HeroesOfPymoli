# HeroesOfPymoli
This is a homework assignment for the Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp. This assignment highlights the use of the Python package Pandas through a fake dataset of purchases made in a videogame. 
In the provided jupyter notebook file, I have created tables displaying patterns in age, gender, top spenders, and top items purchased. 
I have also provided a conclusion of the results at the bottom of the jupyter notebook.
